## Side Notes  

<br/>

The "announcement channel" that you set, must be a regular text channel  
It will not work if "announcement channel" is enabled in the channel settings  
Why? Because I was too lazy to add that code in there, you can do it if you want  
I personally don't use the "announcement channel" feature, so I just didn't add it lol  
It also only supports 2 Patreon Tiers, again this is just because I only use 2 Tiers lol  
IDK what happens if you only use 1 Patron Tier, haven't tried that, don't plan to  
But that's also something you can change in the code if you really wanted to
